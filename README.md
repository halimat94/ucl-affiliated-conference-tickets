# ucl-affiliated-conference-tickets

This is an automated generated list of people who bought tickets to the National Student MedTech Conference 2018, who are affiliated with UCL. Their names were parsed from an eventbrite excel file and placed into a dataframe. This was iterated over, i.e. each person's name was automatically parsed into a search box on the ucl directory page using webdriver and beautiful soup. If their names were found in the directory, the names and UCL emails were returned to a csv file.
